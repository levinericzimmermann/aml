*kagem Karina* is a ~10 minute composition for keyboard quartet (viola, violin, cello, keyboard) & electronics. The working title "AML" is an abbreviation for "Di tempat jauh tidak ada masa lalu" (DTJT**AML**, "In Far-away Places There Is No Past"), named after the poem of Aan Mansyur.

Live-electronics require pyo, pianoteq 6 and the relevant samples. Then electronics can be started through running *main.py* in aml/electronics.
