- add granulated / looped gender samples to right hand of keyboard as an alternative to the modulated sine waves
...better add looped suling samples to right hand of keyboard player

- test again playability with keyboard!

-----

- develop different modules
    - module for string spatialisation / ampflification. goals: (1) deindividualisation of player (2) bring intimite close and quiet sounds closer to audience (3) adjust sound of string instruments to put them closer to the gong sounds
    - module for sample trigger (mainly processed *gender* samples, triggered by string onsets. pitch choose with the help of keyboard data). goals: (1) making a more blurry sound scape, (2) emphazising harmonic and rhythmical structure.
    - module for sine waves with frequencies that has been found by the yin algorithm when analysing string pitch. goals: (1) making a more blurry soundscape
    - module for triggering
